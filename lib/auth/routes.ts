/**
 * Route classification for middleware-level route protection (§14/§15). Reflects the ACTUAL route
 * tree under app/ as inspected directly for this phase — nothing here is invented. Next.js route
 * groups like (app) and (designer) are organizational only and never appear in the real URL, so
 * this classifies by the real path, not by which group folder a page happens to live in.
 *
 * Deliberately isomorphic (no server-only imports) — lib/supabase/middleware.ts (Edge middleware)
 * and any future client-side nav code can both import classifyRoute() safely.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE on "customer"/"designer" levels: for this phase, both require only a valid
 * authenticated session — NOT that a customer_profiles/designer_profiles row actually exists yet.
 * The /onboarding and /designer-onboarding wizards that create those rows are still mock (§19, §24
 * — profile completion stays a separate concern from authentication, and full frontend/business
 * integration is a later phase), so gating on profile existence here would lock a freshly
 * authenticated user out of the very pages that let them pick a role. Tightening "customer"/
 * "designer" to also require the matching profile row is a one-line change to the checks in
 * lib/supabase/middleware.ts once those wizards write real data.
