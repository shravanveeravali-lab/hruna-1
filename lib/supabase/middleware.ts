/**
 * Refreshes the Supabase auth session cookie on every matched request, AND enforces page-level
 * route protection (Phase 3 — see lib/auth/routes.ts's classifyRoute()). Phase 2 deliberately left
 * this file session-refresh-only ("role-based route protection is Phase 3, not this one") — that
 * phase boundary is exactly where this now picks up.
 *
 * Why session refresh needs to exist at all: Supabase's auth tokens are short-lived and stored in
 * cookies. Server Components can read cookies but — per Next.js — cannot reliably write them back
 * (lib/supabase/server.ts's setAll swallows that failure for exactly this reason). Without
 * something refreshing the session cookie on the way in, a long-lived browser session would
 * eventually start reading with an expired token in every Server Component. Middleware runs
 * before rendering and CAN write cookies, so it's the correct place for this.
 *
 * What the route-protection half deliberately does NOT do: gate "customer"/"designer" routes on
 * whether a customer_profiles/designer_profiles row exists (see lib/auth/routes.ts's scope note),
 * or gate anything on approved-designer status (that's an ACTION-level check via
 * requireApprovedDesigner(), not a page-level one — no current DESIGNER route in §15 requires it
 * just to view the page). "admin" is the one level checked against real, trusted database state
 * here, via the same is_admin() SQL function the RLS policies use — never a client-supplied value.
