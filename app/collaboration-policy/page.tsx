          A customer discovers a designer and submits a fashion request. A designer sends a
          proposal in response. Once the customer accepts a proposal, it becomes a project. The
          two collaborate through messaging and project updates until the work is ready, at which
          point the customer confirms completion.

        HRUNA facilitates the connection and collaboration between customers and designers. It
        does not currently process payment, shipping, delivery, or returns as part of the
        platform — any such arrangement for a commissioned piece is agreed directly between the
        customer and the designer, outside HRUNA&apos;s current feature set.
