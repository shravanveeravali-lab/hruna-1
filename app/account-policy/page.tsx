    id: "why-retained",
    heading: "Why some records are retained",
    body: (
      <p>
        LILIRVE&apos;s database intentionally keeps certain records — like a completed project, a
        review, or an existing dispute — tied to the account, rather than letting them be silently
        deleted along with it. This exists to protect other people&apos;s records: for example, a
        designer&apos;s completed project and the review a customer left on it shouldn&apos;t
        disappear just because the customer&apos;s account is deleted, since that project and
        review are also part of the designer&apos;s history on the platform. Financial/subscription
        records are retained for the same reason — they&apos;re treated as records that
        shouldn&apos;t silently vanish. We do not promise that every historical record tied to your
        account is immediately and permanently deleted upon request when doing so would affect
        another user&apos;s data.

        profile, saved items, Fashion Diary, uploaded files, and conversations tied only to you are
        removed along with it.
