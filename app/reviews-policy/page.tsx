          Reviews on HRUNA are written by customers about a specific completed project — a
          customer can leave one review per project, once that project is marked completed. A
          review includes a rating and written text, and is shown publicly on the reviewed
          designer&apos;s studio page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews are permanent once submitted — there is currently no way to edit or delete a
          review after posting. There is no designer-to-customer review system.
