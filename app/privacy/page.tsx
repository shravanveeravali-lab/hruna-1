          <li><strong>Account information</strong> — your name and email address, managed through Supabase Auth.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer profile information</strong> — display name, city, phone number, and profile photo.</li>
          <li><strong>Designer profile &amp; studio information</strong> — studio name, contact email, opening hours, atelier location, highlights, portfolio/collection content, and designer verification submissions (identity and portfolio review materials).</li>
          <li><strong>Requests, proposals &amp; projects</strong> — the fashion requests you submit, proposals you send or receive, and project details and updates exchanged during a collaboration.</li>
          <li><strong>Messages</strong> — text and images exchanged directly between a customer and a designer within a conversation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reviews</strong> — ratings and review text a customer writes about a completed project.</li>
          <li><strong>Saved items &amp; Fashion Diary</strong> — designers, dresses, collections, or projects you save, and any private Fashion Diary entries you create.</li>
          <li><strong>Uploaded images and files</strong> — avatars, studio images, request/project images, and verification documents, stored via our media storage provider.</li>
          <li><strong>Notification preferences</strong> — your choices about which notifications you want to receive.</li>

        be seen by other users; others (like verification documents and Fashion Diary images) are
        private and access-restricted to you and, where relevant, HRUNA administrators. File

        customer you&apos;re interacting with, so the collaboration can actually happen. This
        sharing is limited to what&apos;s needed for that interaction — a designer you&apos;ve
        never contacted has no access to your private information.

        application code never sees or stores it in plain text. Access to your data is additionally
        enforced at the database level through Row Level Security — meaning even a technical error
        elsewhere in the application cannot expose your private data to another user, because the
        database itself rejects unauthorized access.
