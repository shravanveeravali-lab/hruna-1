          Being transparent about where this stands: HRUNA doesn&apos;t yet have a self-service
          &ldquo;Report&rdquo; button on reviews, messages, or profiles, and there isn&apos;t
          currently a page where you can file or track a dispute yourself. Disputes today are
          handled internally — a HRUNA administrator reviews the situation, tracks it through a
          fixed process (open → under review → resolved → closed), and can add notes as it&apos;s
          worked through.
        </p>
        <p>
          To raise any of the issues above, use the{" "}
          <Link href="/help" className="text-primary hover:underline">Help Center</Link> or{" "}
          <Link href="/support" className="text-primary hover:underline">Contact Support</Link>{" "}
          for now. We&apos;ll route it internally. As HRUNA grows, we intend to build a proper
          self-service reporting and dispute-tracking experience.

        For a disagreement specifically about an ongoing project, we recommend first trying to
        resolve it directly with the other party through messaging — most issues can be sorted out
        that way. If that doesn&apos;t work, reach out as described above.
