/**
 * Generic authenticated file upload — the one place any customer-facing upload surface (avatar,
 * request images, diary images) goes through. Uses the AUTHENTICATED server client throughout
 * (never lib/supabase/admin.ts), so Supabase Storage's own storage.objects RLS policies
 * (supabase/migrations/20260829180014_storage.sql) are the real gate on what bucket/path a given
 * user can write to — this route doesn't re-decide that, it just uploads as the calling user and
 * lets Storage accept or reject it.
 *
 * Every object is written under `${user.id}/${entityType}/...` — the exact path-prefix convention
 * every bucket's storage.objects INSERT policy already requires.
